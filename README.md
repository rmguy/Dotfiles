# Dotfiles

This is a fairly dumb mirror of my .vim directory. It will not work out
of the box (godeps need installation, ycm needs building etc).

# TODO:
* Add an install script that installs pathogen and clones appropriate
  bundles.
* Document installation procedure for go packages.
* Remove unwanted bundles.

This is to test modifications to a pr with stacked patches, patch1: patch2 (I'm now modifying patch 2 and I would like it to show up in that diff instead of patch 3)
