# Dotfiles

This is a fairly dumb mirror of my .vim directory. It will not work out
of the box (godeps need installation, ycm needs building etc).

# TODO:
* Add an install script that installs pathogen and clones appropriate
  bundles.
* Document installation procedure for go packages.
* Remove unwanted bundles.

Patch 1: Patch2 (these are some patch2 details i would like to show up in patch2 commit)
